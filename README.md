Description:
This project is a personalized movie recommendation system designed to enhance user experience by suggesting relevant content based on individual preferences. The system leverages cosine similarity and collaborative filtering techniques to analyze user behavior and generate accurate recommendations.

A comprehensive dataset containing movie ratings and metadata was utilized to train the model, ensuring high-quality and personalized suggestions. The system identifies patterns in user preferences and compares them with similar users to recommend movies that align with their tastes.

Key Features:

Cosine Similarity: Measures the similarity between users or movies based on their rating patterns.

Collaborative Filtering: Predicts user preferences by analyzing the behavior of similar users.

Dataset: Utilizes a rich dataset of movie ratings and metadata to ensure accurate recommendations.

User-Centric: Delivers personalized movie suggestions tailored to individual user preferences.

Project Impact:
This project was presented during my internship at Amit Learning, where it received positive feedback from attendees for its innovative approach and practical application. The system demonstrates the power of machine learning in creating user-centric solutions for entertainment platforms like Netflix.

Technologies Used:

Python

Scikit-learn (for cosine similarity)

Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)

Collaborative Filtering Algorithms

Jupyter Notebook (for development and presentation)
